# New rails project
$ rails new <project>

# To create a new controller, you will need to run the "controller" generator and tell it you want a controller called "Welcome" with an action called "index", just like this
$ bin/rails generate controller Welcome index

Using the request/response cycle as a guide, this has been our workflow when making a Rails app.

1.  Generate a new Rails app.
2.  Generate a controller and add an action.
3.  Create a route that maps a URL to the controller action.
4.  Create a view with HTML and CSS.
5.  Run the local web server and preview the app in the browser

A data base works like this I guess

1.  When you type http://localhost:8000/welcome, the browser makes a request for the URL /welcome.
2.  The request hits the Rails router.
3.  The router maps the URL to a controller action to handle the request.
4.  The controller action recieves the request, and asks the model to fetch data from the database.
5.  The model returns data to the controller action.
6.  The controller action passes the data on to the view.
7.  The view renders the page as HTML.
8.  The controller sends the HTML back to the browser.

When in doubt!
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
